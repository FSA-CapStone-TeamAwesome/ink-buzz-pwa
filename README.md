# Ink Buzz

Live Demo: [https://ink-buzz.web.app/](https://ink-buzz.web.app/)

Ink Buzz is a social media platform where users can connect with tattoo artists. This was a group project built in 15 days during Fullstack Academy's 2202 cohort and is intended to showcase a minimum viable product for a social media app with crypto built-in.

## General Information

- We built the site as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) so it would be available on all platforms without any extra fees or restrictions. Using React, Redux Toolkit, and the Chakra component library, the front end is completely responsive for all screen sizes. On the back end, we used Firebase for authentication, storage, and hosting.

- We each learned a lot when it comes to managing a project using Git/GitHub, working together in an agile environment, and using new and innovative ways of utilizing services like Firebase (version 9) and PWA optimization.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Coinbase Wallet SDK
- Ethers
- Web3
- Chakra
- React Bootstrap
- Firebase
- React Router DOM
- React Toastify

## Features

- View and search for tattoo designs, as well as view additional details on a specific design
- Favorite a particular design and follow the artist so their designs appear on the user's feed
- Message artists and vice versa
- Edit user profiles by connecting a crypto wallet and uploading a profile picture
- View a main feed of all the designs from artists users follow
- See users own designs, favorites, people who they are following, and all of their followers
- Upload users own designs to showcase and potentially sell

### Crypto Features
- Crypto wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase built in
- Pay directly within the chat window using a connected wallet.

- Add pagination so only a certain number of designs render on the main page (currently limited to 18 designs)
- View feature designs at the top of the page
